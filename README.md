# Yu-Gi-Oh! Konami Registration Form Autofill

This React application helps you fill out Yu-Gi-Oh! Konami registration forms using YDK files. Upload your YDK file, and the app will automatically populate the necessary fields in the registration form. This is a faster way to fill out these forms as card names can be quite long and are often misspelled.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload YDK files to autofill the registration form.
- **Form Autofill**: Automatically fills in the form fields based on the uploaded YDK file data.
- **Downloadable PDF**: Allows you to download the filled registration form as a PDF.
- **Banlist Validation**: Will let the users know if they have banned cards in their filled decklist and which one's they are.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```

There is a demo ydk file within the root folder of the project that you can use to test out how the application works.
